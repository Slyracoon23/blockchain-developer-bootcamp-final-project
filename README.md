### What is Defi Legos?
Defi Legos utilizes block-based coding to create complicated smart-contract with little to no coding experience! It creates defi pipelines from basic defi primitives/tools(e.g. swaps, pool mining, staking, flash loans, ...) from various Etherium Defi protocols (eg. Maker, Uniswap, Aave, ..) to create complicated functionality.

### Why Defi Legos?
Defi Legos aims to provide smart-contract building capabilites to people with little to no prior coding experience. With its lego like composiability anyone will be able to create complicated smart-contracts.
